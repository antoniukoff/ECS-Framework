## Installation

### Clone the Repository:
- Clone the EvolveECS repository into your desired folder:
```
     git clone https://github.com/antoniukoff/InfernoEngine-Demo
```

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Visual Studio installed, as the project is configured for this IDE.
- The engine is built for 32-bit (x86) systems.

### Opening the Project:
- Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio.
- Choose any available demo projects as the startup project.

### Building and Running:
- Build the project in 'Debug' mode for the x86 platform.
- Run the project to explore the features of EvolveECS.

## Features

- **XML Data-Oriented Parsing**: Integration with TinyXML for robust and efficient data handling.
- **3D Frustrum Culling**: Optimization technique to enhance rendering performance in complex scenes.
- **Collision Debug Meshes Drawing**: Tools for visualizing and debugging collision detection.
- **Ray Cast Collision Detection**: Advanced algorithm for precise collision checks.
- **Physics Constraints**: Includes mouse click, plane, and straight-line constraints for dynamic simulation control.

## Future Development Plans

As EvolveECS continues to grow, we are looking forward to adding:

- **Cross-Platform Build System**
- **Dedicated AI Engine**
- **Spatial Partitioning**
- **Renderer Abstraction**
